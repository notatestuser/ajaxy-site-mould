ajaxy-site-mould
================
A simple skeleton that I commonly tend to use for quick (and sometimes dirty) sites with a PHP backend

Something cool
--------------
It works with Google crawler's use of _escaped_fragment_ for indexing AJAX sites.

Get it going
------------
Drop it into a folder on a web server with a PHP 5 interpreter and you should see 
something you can build upon. There's a functional build script in build/.
